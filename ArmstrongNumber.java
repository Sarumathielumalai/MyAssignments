			// Assign input into variable original 
			// Use loop to calculate: use while loop to set condition until the number greater than 0
			// Within loop: get the remainder when done by 10 (Tip: Use Mod operator)
			// Within loop: get the quotient when done by 10 (Tip: Assign the result to input)
			// Within loop: Add calculated with the cube of remainder & assign it to calculated
			// Check whether calculated and original are same
			//When it matches print it as Armstrong number
